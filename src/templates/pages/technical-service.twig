                    staff to help our customers achieve their goals of consistent high quality and smooth 
                    production. The scope of their knowledge of materials and resins includes our entire 
                    line of thermoset.<br><br>
                    In today’s highly competitive marketplace our customers must make proper choices from 
                    concept to final production. Plenco technical representatives are trained in the latest 
                    processing techniques. They work with customers to discuss material or resin 
                    characteristics and processing techniques. Close attention to the best match of 
                    material or resin for the process can help reduce the potential for process variations 
                    and downtime. If processing difficulties do arise, prompt “hands on” response by Plenco 
                    technical representatives can help resolve processing issues.<br><br>
                    Other important activities facilitated by our technical representatives include 
                    laboratory tests, material selection, certifications, inventory management concepts, 
                    and alternate packaging.<br><br>
                    Plenco will gladly arrange a visit by one of our technical representatives to discuss 
                    which of our products will best serve your needs. (Technical Service text)",
