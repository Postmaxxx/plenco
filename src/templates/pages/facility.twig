                    strict process control as well as molding materials with a high level of quality and 
                    consistency. The engineering of our manufacturing factory and its expansions has produced a 
                    facility deliberately designed around large capacity production, smooth efficient flow of 
                    manufacturing processes, and adaptability to equipment and product change. Throughout its 
                    design history, manufacturing cost containment has been a key element. Well-developed 
                    preventive maintenance programs (PMP) assure the consistent on-time delivery of Plenco 
                    products.<br><br>
                    At all levels, our plant operations utilize management practices and the best available 
                    technology to maximize product quality and minimize environmental impact. These carefully 
                    planned efforts have reduced production waste to levels approaching zero. The United States 
                    Environmental Protection Agency has awarded Plenco a Letter of Commendation in recognition
